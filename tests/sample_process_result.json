For my first project, I built a framework to benchmark compression algorithms, successfully reducing NPC 3D model memory usage by 50% using a custom vector quantization scheme that lowered bandwidth usage by 30%. In the second project, I implemented a prototype GPU ray tracer to compare BVH layouts and constructed a mesh clustering algorithm to maximize vertex cache reuse. My CUDA kernels for BVH construction employed warp-level parallelization and shared memory, improving build times.\\nTech Stack: C++, OpenGL, CUDA, GLSL, PSSL, CMake, vcpkg, Python",
        "ranking_reason": "Best fit because this candidate has demonstrated experience with CUDA and C++ in a performance-critical domain (game development). The candidate's work on GPU profiling and ray tracing, along with their mesh compression project, directly aligns with the requirements of the role. The ability to optimize code for GPU architectures and solve performance bottlenecks is highly valuable.",
