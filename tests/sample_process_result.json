      "item_data": "Project Name: Lung Cancer Detection\\nDuration: null to null\\nDescription: Created four U-Net CNN architectures for 3D MRI image segmentation to detect lung cancer. Preprocessed and augmented a dataset of 63 MRI scans to improve generalization. Achieved 78% accuracy on validation using a tailored training loop and spatial data augmentations. Worked as a team of two to iterate on model design and training strategies. This experience provided deep exposure to practical problem solving in a collaborative environment, requiring strong communication, technical precision, and iterative design. I contributed to technical discussions, wrote detailed documentation, participated in code reviews, and adapted quickly to emerging challenges. Through hands-on implementation and performance tuning, I was able to improve outcomes that aligned with organizational goals, end-user needs, and system-level constraints. Used custom U-Nets to detect lung cancer from 3D MRI images with high accuracy.\\nTech Stack: Pytorch, Python, OpenCV",
      "ranking_reason": "Best fit because the project demonstrates strong problem-solving skills in a domain (medical imaging) that could potentially align with applications in the federal ecosystem. The implementation of U-Net CNN architectures for 3D MRI image segmentation showcases technical complexity and the use of deep learning, which is highly relevant to NVIDIA's focus. The project's focus on accuracy and iterative model design, along with the use of Python and PyTorch, aligns well with the role's requirements. The candidate's ability to work in a team and achieve a concrete result (78% accuracy) further strengthens its appeal.",
