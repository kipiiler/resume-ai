Experience Results:
------------------------------

Experience 1:
ID: 1
Ranking Reason: Best fit because this candidate demonstrates a strong ability to learn and apply new technologies, as evidenced by their work with TensorFlow.js, React, and TypeScript. Their experience building a real-time body-pose tracking pipeline, including performance optimization, showcases a practical understanding of problem-solving and a focus on impact. The use of unit tests further aligns with Splunk's emphasis on quality. The candidate's experience with AWS Lambda and Cognito, even if limited, provides some relevant cloud exposure. The candidate's experience is recent, showing a current ability to learn and adapt. The candidate's experience also shows a good understanding of the full development lifecycle.
Bullet Points:
- Engineered real-time body-pose tracking using TensorFlow.js and YOLOv5, which increased client-side render FPS from 20 to 60.
- Developed a custom TypeScript visualization library with 20+ charts, integrating Nivo.js, which provided robust data analysis capabilities.
- Implemented AWS Lambda and Cognito-based authentication workflows, which contributed to secure backend infrastructure.


Experience 2:
ID: 3
Ranking Reason: Strong candidate due to their experience developing a full-stack application with React, TypeScript, and a serverless AWS backend. Their project aligns closely with the role's requirements, demonstrating familiarity with key technologies like React, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and RDS. The use of unit and e2e tests further strengthens their profile. The candidate's ability to build a complete application from frontend to backend, integrating with external services (Microsoft Teams), indicates a good understanding of system architecture and practical problem-solving. The candidate's experience is recent, showing a current ability to learn and adapt.
Bullet Points:
- Developed a full-stack application using React, TypeScript, and AWS serverless technologies (Lambda, API Gateway, RDS), which streamlined internal coaching session analysis.
- Integrated Microsoft Graph API and SAML-based SSO into the React frontend, which provided secure user authentication and real-time meeting data retrieval.
- Implemented unit and e2e tests with Jest for the full-stack application, which ensured code quality and robustness in a cloud environment.


Experience 3:
ID: 7
Ranking Reason: Solid option with a good foundation in relevant technologies like Docker, Python, and AWS. Their experience building automation and monitoring systems for the SWE Club demonstrates practical application of these skills. The use of FastAPI and the integration of CI/CD pipelines are also valuable. While the scope might be smaller than other experiences, the hands-on experience with Docker and AWS is directly transferable. The candidate's experience is recent, showing a current ability to learn and adapt.
Bullet Points:
- Engineered an automated interview platform using Django, PostgreSQL, and AWS EC2, which saved 3 hours/week in officer time.
- Developed a container monitoring service with FastAPI, Docker SDK, and DynamoDB, improving system uptime by 30%.
- Integrated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Docker, reducing manual maintenance efforts by 50%.


Project Results:
------------------------------

Project 1:
ID: 2
Ranking Reason: Best fit because the project demonstrates strong alignment with the role's requirements. It utilizes Go, Docker, and REST APIs, which are key technologies mentioned in the job description. The implementation of a distributed poker-bot tournament platform showcases an understanding of backend development, scalability, and containerization, all valuable skills for a Software Engineer Intern at Splunk. The use of RabbitMQ, Postgres, and Redis further indicates familiarity with relevant technologies. The project's architecture, including hexagonal design, suggests a focus on maintainability and testability, important aspects of software engineering.
Bullet Points:
- Developed distributed poker-bot platform using Go and Docker, which demonstrated skills in backend development and containerization.
- Designed scalable API with Gin and Gorilla, by implementing hexagonal architecture, which highlighted REST API proficiency.
- Integrated RabbitMQ for code execution and Postgres/Redis for data, which showcase knowledge of relevant technologies.


Project 2:
ID: 3
Ranking Reason: Strong relevance due to its use of Python and Docker, both of which are listed in the job description. The project's focus on building a chatbot and integrating it with Discord demonstrates an understanding of API interactions and deployment. The use of Redis and Postgres for state tracking aligns with the requirements. While the project's domain is different from Splunk's focus, the technical skills and architectural considerations are transferable, and the project demonstrates an ability to work with relevant technologies.
Bullet Points:
- Generated a Rick Sanchez-themed Discord chatbot by fine-tuning DialoGPT with PyTorch, which demonstrated proficiency in Python and transformer models.
- Containerized chatbot with Docker, integrating Redis and Postgres for stateful interactions on Discord, which aligned with the job's emphasis on containerization and distributed systems.
- Optimized text generation using hyperparameter tuning and prompt engineering, which improved model perplexity by 12%, showcasing hands-on performance tuning and debugging.


Project 3:
ID: 4
Ranking Reason: Good option with a balanced view of technical strengths and applicability. The project leverages Python, which is a relevant language. The focus on image segmentation and use of CNNs, while not directly related to Splunk's core business, demonstrates strong problem-solving skills and an understanding of machine learning concepts. The project's collaborative nature and focus on achieving high accuracy are positive indicators. However, the lack of Docker or REST API experience makes it slightly less relevant than projects 2 and 3.
Bullet Points:
- Developed four 3D U-Net CNN architectures using Python and PyTorch for lung cancer detection, achieving 78% validation accuracy through iterative model design and training.
- Implemented image preprocessing and augmentation techniques with OpenCV on a 63 MRI scan dataset, enhancing model generalization and performance.
- Collaborated within a team, contributing to technical discussions and documentation, showcasing strong problem-solving and communication skills, and improving outcomes.
